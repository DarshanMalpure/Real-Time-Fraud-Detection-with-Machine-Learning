# Real-Time Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a robust machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset. The goal is to develop a predictive tool that can effectively minimize financial risk by accurately flagging suspicious activity.

The core of this project is an end-to-end data science pipeline, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing to model evaluation and deployment readiness.

## üîç Project Highlights

**Data Analysis**: Performed in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics, including feature distributions and the severe class imbalance inherent in fraud detection.

**Preprocessing & Imbalance Handling**: Implemented data preprocessing techniques, including feature scaling, and addressed the class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to prevent model bias.

**Model Building**: Trained and evaluated several machine learning classifiers, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to determine the most effective model for the task.

**Performance Evaluation**: Utilized key evaluation metrics beyond accuracy, focusing on precision-recall curves and the confusion matrix to measure the model's ability to correctly identify fraud with minimal false positives.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools

**Programming Language**: Python

**Libraries**:
- `pandas` & `numpy`: For data manipulation and numerical operations
- `scikit-learn`: For implementing machine learning models and preprocessing steps
